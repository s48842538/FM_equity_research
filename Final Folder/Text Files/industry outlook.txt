The outlook for Australiaâ€™s industrial property sector in 2025 remains positive, though growth is moderating after several years of rapid expansion. New supply is expected to decline, especially in Melbourne, which should help stabilize vacancy rates and support steady rental growth in key urban markets. Demand fundamentals remain strong, driven by population growth, e-commerce, and supply chain onshoring, with urban infill assets in Sydney and Melbourne continuing to attract tenants and investors [4]. While rental growth is becoming more localized and some precincts are seeing increased competition, industrial property remains the most favoured commercial sector, with stable yields and resilient land values expected through the year [6].
