The DCF valuations for CIP gave two differing share price values. Pulling data from Simply Wall St and Alpha Spread[6][7], a conservative approach, directly forecasting free cash flow (FCF), produces a lower share price estimate of $2.12, a downside of 27% from the current stock price of $2.92, reflecting expectations of declining FCF despite stable or growing revenue. Alternatively, using a revenue-based approach-where FCF is calculated from the average of prior years’ FCF-to-revenue ratios and applied to forecasted revenue, yields a much higher valuation of $3.83 per share, an upside of 16%. This difference is due to  the different assumptions about future margins and cash conversion, with some forecasts anticipating rising costs or capital needs that could weigh on FCF even as revenue grows[6]. The wide DCF range underscores the need to closely examine both revenue and cash flow assumptions when valuing CIP and suggests that the market may be underestimating the trust’s ability to translate revenue growth into sustainable free cash flow.
