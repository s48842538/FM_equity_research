Given the company’s share price valuation and operational outlook, we recommend a Buy on Centuria Industrial REIT. This decision is underpinned by a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, which values CIP at $3.38 per share-well above its recent trading level of $2.92. This valuation is further supported by the trust’s strong fundamentals, including high occupancy rates, long lease expiries, and significant re-leasing spreads that underpin stable and resilient cash flows. CIP’s share price also trades at a meaningful discount to its net tangible assets (NTA), providing investors with a margin of safety. While DCF scenarios using more conservative free cash flow forecasts suggest a lower bound of $2.12 per share, the higher-end valuation of $3.83 demonstrates substantial upside potential if CIP can maintain historical cash conversion rates as revenue grows. Additionally, the prospect of monetary policy easing and sustained demand for industrial assets in key urban markets serve as clear catalysts for a re-rating. We believe the market is underestimating CIP’s ability to convert revenue growth into sustainable free cash flow and expect the share price to increase to a higher intrinsic value as these factors materialize.
