Centuria Industrial REIT (CIP) continues to demonstrate strong financial performance, highlighting the resilience and quality of its portfolio. In the first half of FY25, CIP reported funds from operations (FFO) of $56.6 million, translating to 8.9 cents per unit, with distributions rising to 8.1 cents per unit. Statutory profit reached $62.6 million, up from $54.1 million in the previous year, reflecting both income growth and effective cost management. The trust achieved a 6.4% like-for-like net operating income (NOI) increase, driven by robust re-leasing spreads averaging 50% across 79,000 square meters of leasing activity, which underscores CIP’s ability to secure premium rents in a tight industrial market. High occupancy was maintained at 97.1%, and with gearing at 33.5%, a high proportion of debt hedged, and $233 million in liquidity, CIP is well positioned to navigate market volatility[1]. Management’s reaffirmed full-year guidance further demonstrates confidence in the trust’s income stability and growth outlook.
