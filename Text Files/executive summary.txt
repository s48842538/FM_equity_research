Centuria Industrial REIT (ASX: CIP) is currently undervalued by the market, as demonstrated by a robust discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation that places its intrinsic value at $3.38 per share-well above its recent trading levels-reflecting conservative assumptions for free cash flow growth and a growth rate of 3%. This valuation is further supported by CIP’s strong fundamentals, including high portfolio occupancy, long lease expiries, and significant re-leasing spreads, all of which underpin stable and resilient cash flows. Additionally, CIP’s share price trades at a substantial discount to net tangible assets (NTA), providing a margin of safety, while the prospect of monetary policy easing and continued demand for industrial assets offer clear catalysts for a re-rating. The buy thesis rests on the expectation that the market will eventually recognize CIP’s intrinsic value, as supported by the DCF model, and close the gap between price and value.
